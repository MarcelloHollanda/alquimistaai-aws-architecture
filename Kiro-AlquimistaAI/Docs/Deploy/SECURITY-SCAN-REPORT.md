## Detailed Findings

### Dependency Vulnerabilities






#### Moderate/Low Severity Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities should be addressed in regular maintenance cycles.


### CDK Security Validation


#### CDK-NAG Security Issues





**Actions:**
1. Review the CDK-NAG findings above
2. Fix security issues in your CDK code
3. Or add suppressions with justification if issues are false positives
4. Re-run: `npm run security:full`


## Next Steps

### For Dependency Issues
1. Review the full audit report: `npm audit`
2. Fix vulnerabilities: `npm audit fix`
3. For manual fixes: `npm audit fix --force` (review breaking changes)
4. Re-run security scan: `npm run security:check`

### For CDK Security Issues
1. Review CDK-NAG findings: `npm run cdk:nag`
2. Fix security issues in your CDK constructs
3. Add suppressions for false positives with proper justification
4. Re-run full security scan: `npm run security:full`
